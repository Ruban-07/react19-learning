# React - A Javascript Library🔥

One of the most professional and powerfull language

## Disclaimer ⚠️

**Don't get into react, without having basic knowledge in `Javascript`**

The `Javascript` the one only language which browser can understand. All other languages we're using won't rendered without the help of `Javascript`. And we must known the `ES6` syntaxes.

React is the number one most popular language in the world.

React is the Backbone of key stacks like:

- M E R N - `M`ongoDB | `E`xpress.js | `R`eact | `N`ode.js
- P E R N - `P`ostgreSQL | `E`xpress.js | `R`eact | `N`ode.js

We can do mobile applications, using `React Native` and also we can integrate it in `NextJs` for full stack web application.

## Virtual DOM🍁

The `Virtual DOM` is the simlified map of our web page. When something changes, react create new `Virtual DOM` Element. Then it only update the changed part alone to speedup the application.

It's like to change a single tile color in wall, instead of re-coloring the complete wall.

## Node.js🛠️

`Node.js` is the `Javascript` runtime, to run the `Javascript` outside the browser. `React` has the dependency of `Node.js`, so before setup `React`, we must setup `Node.js` to our machine.

While installing `Node.js`, you'll get an handy tool called `npm` - Node Package Manager.

Instead of writing everything from scratch, you can add package using `npm` for animations, forms and etc. And also it'll keep your tools and codes up-to-date.

## Code Editor🖊️

There are many code editors, but I'll prefer the modern and light weight code editor, which is `VS Code` - Visual Studio Code.

## Git 💫

I prefer personally to must gain knowledge in `git`, whatever languages you work, that's not a matter, but the `Version Control System` is the most important thing to track your code.

## Create React Application🆕

Creating a New React App can be done in multiple ways, and the legacy way is `create react app`.

But currently there is an modern build tool called `Vite`, which is an Building tool for `React`. By using that we can create our react application very easily. The below command will help to create react app using `Vite`:<br/>

`npm create vite@latest`

## Vite Config File⚙️

`vite.config.ts` : This file is used for customize the application building process, like adding plugins, configuring service settings and more.

## Package JSON File📦

`package.json` : This file contains the `meta data` of our project, such as:<br/>

- name
- scripts
- dependencies
- devDependencies

## Package Lock JSON File📦

`package-lock.json` : This file is automatically generated, when you run `npm install`. It'll lock down the versions of the dependencies installed in your project

If someone cloned this code and install our app, then they'll get exactly that same version of package that we used in our project.

## Index HTML File📂

`index.html` : This is the file where our app is loaded. Which contains the `root` and `scripts` for our project.

## ES Lint Configuration File⚙️

`eslint.config.js` : This is a config file to manage rules and settings of `ESLint`. It helps us to identify and fix problems in our code, such as:<br/>

- Coding Style Violations
- Errors
- Potential Bugs

## Git Ignore File🚫

`.gitignore` - This file will tells git, that which files and folder should ignore while pushing our code to `repo`. The most important thing must be ignored is `node_modules`. And also, ignore `.env` file which contains our environment variables.

## Node Modules⛰️

This folder contains all the installed dependencies for our project. Everything `React`, `Vite` and more. This is the most huge folder in our project. This is completed managed by `npm`.

## Public📢

This is the folder, which contains static assets, like image, icons and other folder, which you want to not allowed to `vite bundler`.

## Src🗃️

This is the place where our `React` component and you `Javascript` logics are there.

## App File🌐

`App.tsx` : This is the main UI of our app is defined. Whatever we write here, will appear on the website.

## Main File🚪

`main.tsx` : This is entry point of the `React` app. Where react is rendered into the `DOM`.

## Assets🗄️

In this assets folder, we'll keep all our media files like image, videos and more.

## Components⚛️

There two ways to define a `Component` in `React`:

- Class Component
- Functional Component

## Class Component🏫

This is the treditional way to define the component.

```javascript
class ClassComponent extends React.Compoent {
  render() {
    return <h2>Class Component</h2>;
  }
}
```

This method is outdated, there is a better way, the `functional component` is better than this.

## Functional Component🚀

```javascript
function App() {}
export default App;
```

There is an modern method `Arrow Components`, which is the way widely used.

> Arrow Components

```javascript
const App = () => {
  return <h2>Functional Arrow Component</h2>;
};

export default App;
```

This `Arrow Components` method is preferable.

The Beauty of `React Component` is use create as many use like.

If you create a component, use can use it `n` times you want. This will be reusable.

## Props🚘

In `React` the `props` is shortend of `Properties`. This `props` is mainly used to pass data from one component to another. Typically we pass data from parent component to child component.

The `props` is like an argument that we pass to the function.

## Styling💇

We can give stylings through:

1. Inline Style
2. CSS
3. Tailwind CSS
4. Bootstrap
5. Material UI
6. Ant UI
7. SASS
8. CSS in JS
9. CSS Module we name it

we can choose these any approach to style our ui.

## States 🛣️

The `state` is the brain of the `React Component`, it holds the information about the components that can change over time.

## Hooks 🪝

The `Hooks` are special functions in `React` that let you tap into the react features
