# React - A Javascript Library🔥

One of the most professional and powerfull language

## Disclaimer ⚠️

**Don't get into react, without having basic knowledge in `Javascript`**

The `Javascript` the one only language which browser can understand. All other languages we're using won't rendered without the help of `Javascript`. And we must known the `ES6` syntaxes.

React is the number one most popular language in the world.

React is the Backbone of key stacks like:

- M E R N - `M`ongoDB | `E`xpress.js | `R`eact | `N`ode.js
- P E R N - `P`ostgreSQL | `E`xpress.js | `R`eact | `N`ode.js

We can do mobile applications, using `React Native` and also we can integrate it in `NextJs` for full stack web application.

## Virtual DOM🍁

The `Virtual DOM` is the simlified map of our web page. When something changes, react create new `Virtual DOM` Element. Then it only update the changed part alone to speedup the application.

It's like to change a single tile color in wall, instead of re-coloring the complete wall.

## Node.js🛠️

`Node.js` is the `Javascript` runtime, to run the `Javascript` outside the browser. `React` has the dependency of `Node.js`, so before setup `React`, we must setup `Node.js` to our machine.

While installing `Node.js`, you'll get an handy tool called `npm` - Node Package Manager.

Instead of writing everything from scratch, you can add package using `npm` for animations, forms and etc. And also it'll keep your tools and codes up-to-date.

## Code Editor🖊️

There are many code editors, but I'll prefer the modern and light weight code editor, which is `VS Code` - Visual Studio Code.

## Git 💫

I prefer personally to must gain knowledge in `git`, whatever languages you work, that's not a matter, but the `Version Control System` is the most important thing to track your code.

## Create React Application🆕

Creating a New React App can be done in multiple ways, and the legacy way is `create react app`.

But currently there is an modern build tool called `Vite`, which is an Building tool for `React`. By using that we can create our react application very easily. The below command will help to create react app using `Vite`:<br/>

`npm create vite@latest`
